## Features

- *Allows reading and writing of ID3 tags*
- *Works for both ID3v1 and ID3v2 (2.3, and in most cases 2.4)*
- *Extremely simple to use. Abstracts the complicated parts*

## Installation

```sh
go get github.com/kalbhor/mutago
```

## Usage

```go
import (
"github.com/kalbhor/mutago"
)
```

Note : The [examples](https://github.com/makebyte/mutago/tree/master/examples) folder contains implementations of all the methods below. It uses a sample mp3 file licensed under creative commons.

### Read methods

##### Open file
```go
f, err := mutago.Open("file.mp3")
if err != nil {
// Handle error
}
defer f.Close() // Always good to close after using
```

##### Provides a list of available tags
```go
tags := f.List() // List() Provides an array of tags in the file. 
```

##### Provides values of basic tags
```go
/*
For basic tags such as song title, album name and artist there are seperate methods. 
(So that you don't need to know the ID3 tag identifier)
*/
title, err := f.Title()
album, err := f.Album()
artist, err := f.Artist()
```

##### Provides values of other tags
```go
/*
For more advanced tags such as comments, year, lead singer, etc.
Use Get() method that fetches the ID3 tag's value, provided the tag identifier.
For a list of valid tags check id3.org.

Get() will return an error if the tag is invalid or doesn't exist in the file.
*/

text, err := f.Get("TXXX")
lead, err := f.Get("TPE1")

```

### Write methods
```go
/*
Yet to be built.

Will be added soon.
*/

```
